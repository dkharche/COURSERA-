Question 1
How do Convolutions improve image recognition?

1 point

They make the image smaller


-->They isolate features in images


They make processing of images faster


They make the image clearer

2.
Question 2
What does the Pooling technique do to the images?

1 point

-->Reduces information in them while maintaining some features


Combines them


Makes them sharper


Isolates features in them

3.
Question 3
True or  False. If you pass a 28x28 image through a 3x3 filter the output will be 26x26

1 point

-->True


False

4.
Question 4
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, the output will be 56x56

1 point

-->False


True

5.
Question 5
How does using Convolutions in our Deep neural network impact training?

1 point

It does not affect training


-->ts impact will depend on other factors.


It makes it slower


It makes it faster
