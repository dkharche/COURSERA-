What is the difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?

Machine learning identifies complex activities such as golf, while traditional programming is better suited to simpler activities such as walking.

-->In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data.

Question 2
What do we call the process of telling the computer what the data represents (i.e. this data is for walking, this data is for running)?



Learning the Data


-->Labelling the Data


Programming the Data


Categorizing the Data

3.
Question 3
What is a Dense layer?



A single neuron


A layer of disconnected neurons


-->A layer of connected neurons


An amount of mass occupying a volume

4.
Question 4
How do you measure how good the current ‘guess’ is?



Figuring out if you win or lose


Training a neural network


-->Using the Loss function

5.
Question 5
What does the optimizer do?


-->Decides to stop training a neural network


Generates a new and improved guess


Figures out how to efficiently compile your code


Measures how good the current guess is

6.
Question 6
What is Convergence?



An analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data.


A programming API for AI


-->The process of getting very close to the correct answer


A dramatic increase in loss

7.
Question 7
What does model.fit do?


It optimizes an existing model


It makes a model fit available memory


-->It trains the neural network to fit one set of values to another


It determines if your activity is good for your body
